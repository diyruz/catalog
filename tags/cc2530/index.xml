As this device is powered by a CC2530 chip, an idea appeared in my head to flash it with a great freepad firmware, which was used in my previous remote controls.
UPD: This keypad has appeared on Aliexpress
Keypad has 8 buttons, two-colored led, and is powered by CR2032 lithium cell.
It is quite easy to disassemble this device.</description></item></channel></rss>
